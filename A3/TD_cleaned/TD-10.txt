 week my friend Billy , who's always been interested in animals , found a pet frog .
 carried the frog everywhere with him all day until it was time to go to sleep .
 pet dog Bowwow said good_night@q to the frog .
 together they got into bed .
 the night the frog hoped out_of the (.) jar and out_of the window .
 while my friend Billy was sleeping .
 Billy woke up the next morning he discovered that the frog was gone .
 looked everywhere for it , in his mother's boots , in the jar , under the bed
 Mister frog where are you ?
 Billy .
 had no idea where to look .
 him and Bowwow dropped down out_of the window .
 they could do anything
 Mister frog where are you ?
 searched into the forest .
 was a beehive nearby .
 tried to ignore it but Bowwow just couldn't .
 bees were just far too interesting
 Mister frog where are you ?
 called down a rabbit hole .
 little rabbit came out
 oy this is my hole !
 said .
 just couldn't take his eyes off that beehive .
 had to go and see what was there .
 it fell down
 woof woof !
 Bowwow
 help me !
 Billy was far too interested in looking for Mister frog .
 was trying to look in the tree .
 suddenly an owl came out
 oh !
 Billy
 you gave me a shock !
 continued to look .
 tried to look over the [/] the larger [*] boulder in the forest .
 suddenly an antelope come out [//] came out !
 carried him off and carried him far , far away .
 it came to a grassy knoll where it let go of Billy .
 Billy fell splash into a pond !
 could hear the sounds of croaking
 maybe its Mister frog ?
 said .
 told Bowwow to be quiet and slowly peered behind the big log .
 there was Mister frog with another frog [//] a lady frog .
 crept down .
 were lots_of little frogs too .
 frog said he was very , very happy with Missus frog .
 so they could give him one of their children instead .
 settled with this and waved goodbye to Mister frog with one of the babies in the hand .
